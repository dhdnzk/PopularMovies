#### About API key
- API key is in res/values/api_key.xml file, but it is excluded by .gitignore file. So, if you want to execute this application, you need to make api_key.xml file and fill it your own API key. If you don't have API key, please check [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api)

- The form of api_key.xml file is like this.
```api_key.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="api_key">enter your api key here</string>
</resources>
```
